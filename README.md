# PPP (Programming principles and practice using C++)

This repository is disposable for holding the answers to the exercises and "Try this" sections from the Bjarne Stroustrup's book Programming Principles and practice using C++ (third edition).

All answers are in the main.cpp file, after each exercise a commit is done, so for finding answers for exercises go to the commit list and search for the specific exercise. **Note that the commit order is the same order the exercises are shown in the book.**  

## Building
This is a Cmake-based project that doesn't require any external libraries.

### MacOS/Linux
```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
```
This guide is using the default generator: Makefiles, if you prefer, you can change it.

### Windows
There isn't a guide on how to build for windows yet. It will be added later.

## Acknowledgments
I wanted to express my deep appreciation for the amazing Bjarne Stroustrup's book, Programming principles and practice using C++.
